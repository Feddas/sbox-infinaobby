Full game details at https://sbox.game/feddas/infinaobby.
This game was an entry into [Game Jam 2](https://sbox.game/c/gamejam2).

# s&box

This was my first project using s&box. s&box is a Unity3d competitor that:
1. Relies on scripting with C#.
2. When not exported, hosts multiplayer servers for free, Roblox style.
3. Allows export, exporting this project was over 2GB.

# Dev TODO

1. Change procedural level generation to be based on how many seconds a player jump lasts for, from leaving ground to touching ground again. Use that seconds value to change the length of the platform cubes and their interval. Currently all platform cubes are the same scale, spawned at an increasing interval. The interval was guesstimated from trial and error.
